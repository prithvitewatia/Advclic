### FAQ
###### Q: What is Advclic?  
**A**: Advclic is a powerful command line calculator.  

###### Q: There are so many calculators. Why should we use Advclic?  
**A**: Well let's be honest most of the command line calculators are terrible.
Also for using other powerful caluclators like Microsoft calculator you need to
shift focus away from command line which I dont like. So this calculator provides 
me access to a powerful calculator while staying in the terminal.

###### Q: How to use the Calculator ?
**A**: The calculator can easily be run typing calculator and pressing enter.
(or ./calculator if you are on Linux or macOS). The complete documentation can be
found here.

###### Q: You also have a commandline calculator (Syclic), then what is the need for this one?
**A**: Well calculator hosted in Syclic is less powerful and supports only basic mathematical operations.
So if you need a basic calculator you should use it and if you need a powerful calculator you should use Advclic.
